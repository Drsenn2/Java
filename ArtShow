/*
In this lab, you complete a partially prewritten Java program that includes methods with no parameters.
The program asks the user if he or she has preregistered for tickets to an art show. 
If the user has preregistered, the program should call a method named discount() that 
displays the message, "You are preregistered and qualify for a 5 percent discount." 
If the user has not preregistered, the program should call a method named noDiscount() that 
displays the message, "Sorry, you did not preregister and do not qualify for a 5 percent discount."

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the input statement. 
Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

Instructions
Ensure the file named ArtShow.java is open.
Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.
Execute the program by clicking "Run Code." */

// ArtShow.java - This program determines if an art show attendee gets a 5% discount

// Input:  Interactive.
// Output:  A statement telling the user if they get a discount or no discount.
